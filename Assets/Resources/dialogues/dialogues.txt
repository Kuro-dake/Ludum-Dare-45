carrot;l:Hello. I am, a narrator, and also a carrot. So, a narrot. <color=green><b>Also, I'm a tutorial, so pay attention when you see text written in green, like this one</b></color>.|carrot;l:I am going to tell you a story about men with dreams.
Our first hero's name is Karl, he's 46 years old, and he's determind to fulfill his ambition. And so he will!|karol;r:Uhhhh...|carrot;l:Karl is a determined financial advisor. He became one after he failed at everything else he attempted in his life. 
Somehow, he's married. But his wife doesn't respect him very much.|carrot;l:And then he met Timmy.|player;r:|carrot;l: Timmy <b>started with nothing</b>, but was tough as hell. 
And thus, through lot of pain and struggle, ended with crippling financial debt.|none;r:|carrot;l: Also, dead.|carrot;l: But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Timmy decided he would become a gangsta. And here's where our story begins.|player;l:|karol;r:I can get you a loan with very favorable interest.|player;l:I need 1000$ so I can buy a gun, and start climbing up the ladder.|karol;r:Okay. Sign here, aaaaand.... done! Your money has been already transfered to your account.|none;r:|carrot;l:Let's not get into details about how Timmy obtained an illegal firearm with lent money.|carrot;l: Or with speed and form of money transactions. You will find that this story is somewhat inconsistent, and doesn't make sense at times. Let's try and not to dwell on these little things, okay?|carrot;l:Also, since Karl is a huge fuckup, he arranged for a loan with terrible terms.|carrot;l:Meanwhile, off goes little Timmy, to hunt a man called the Butcher, one of the two big fish in his town's underground.|playergun;l:He should be somewhere around here.|playergun;l:Hey you!|cutter;r:Huh...?|playergun;l:You the Butcher?|cutter;r:Who's asking?|carrot;l:<color=green><b>Timmy felt confident, because he knew, all he had to do is aim with his mouse, and click left mouse button to shoot.</b></color>|playergun;l:Yo mama.|cutter;r:You're going down you little piece of shit.
--
carrot;l:And so, Timmy shot some random guy with a tiny knife.|player;l:|cutter;r:What the fuck man? You shot me!|player;l:You're done, Butcher. This is my neighborhood now.|cutter;r:The only problem is, I'm not the Butcher.|butch;r:I'm the Butcher.|player;l:Well then, you're going down.|butch;r:Yeah, right. Cut him, boys!
--
carrot;l:And so Timmy won, because he was the only one who didn't bring a knife to a gunfight.|player;l:|karol;r:The bank statement just came in . Good news Timmy! You only owe the bank a measly 300 000$!|player;l:What? But I borrowed a thousand.|karol;r:Well, yes, there was a slight overlook on my part. Plus since you shot the whole Butcher family, their medical bills, and charges for funerals were deducted from your account.|none;r:|carrot;l:Once again, let's not dwell on the fact that this is not how the world works, and continue with our story.|player;l:|karol;r: But the good news is, it isn't 600 000$.|player;l:Why should it be 600 000$?|karol;r:Because of another slight overlook I just fixed.|player;l:I'm going to get my gun.|playergun;l:|karol;r:NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.  You don't need it! We're friends here, right? Besides, there's still the Hans family turf. Once you take it over, you'll be set!|playergun;l:For your sake, I hope you're right.|none;r:|carrot;l:And so Timmy went to take out Hans, and take over his turf.|playergun;l:You Hans?|gunner;r:Who's asking?|playergun;l:Yo mama.|gunner;r:You're going down you little piece of shit.|playergun;l:Deja vu...|gunner;r:Deja vu...|none;r:|carrot;l:Deja vu...|carrot;l:I mean...|carrot;l:That was Timmy's first gunfight. <color=green><b>He had to learn to press the right mouse button to duck. While ducking, Timmy was invincible. 
Unfortunately, his dumb hat would always fall over his eyes, and his accuracy would go down the drain.</b></color>|carrot;l: <color=green><b>Timmy would also quickly learn, that if he shot like crazy in the general direction of his enemies, they would get stressed out, and take cover.</b></color> |carrot;l:<color=green><b>While they were also invincible while ducking, they would take some time to recover - a time Timmy could use to deal with other enemies.</b></color>

player;l:|hans;r:Hey you. Stop shooting my people.|player;l:You Hans?|hans;r:Yup.|player;l:Nice hat...|hans;r:Thanx. Anyway, you're going to die. Let's do this.
--
carrot;l:And so our little story ends. Timmy won the Hans turf. He found several bags full of money in Hans's apartment. Two milion dollars.|carrot;l:Unfortunately, the damages he caused were calculated to 28,034,342.37$.|carrot;l:Timmy was dismantled, and his organs were sold to cover the expenses. Apparently, he had really valuable organs.|karol;r:|carrot;l: For putting a person in so much debt they had to die, Karl received a nice provision from the bank.|carrot;l:His wife decided he's not a total failure, and she won't take the kids (which unbeknownst to him are not his), and leave him for Mark, who works in the grocery store downstairs.|karol;r:Yaaaaaay!|carrot;l:Rumor has it, she even almost let Karl fuck her once.|carrot;l: And that's the story how Karl, the financial advisor, finally fulfilled his ambitions, and how Timmy started with nothing, and ended with crippling financial debt that killed him.|carrot;l:Congratulations! You won! Thank you for playing.
